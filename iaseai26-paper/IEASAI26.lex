  The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation models has democratized visual content creation, yet these systems perpetuate significant cultural biases that undermine their ethical deployment across diverse global communities. While algorithmic approaches to bias mitigation have received considerable attention, the fundamental ethical challenges surrounding cultural representation accuracy and the iterative editing process remain largely unaddressed. This paper presents a comprehensive ethical analysis of cultural bias in state-of-the-art image generation models through a novel multi-step editing framework. We systematically evaluate the T2I → I2I pipeline, measuring how many iterative editing steps are required to achieve culturally appropriate representations for Korean and Chinese contexts. Through controlled experiments and user surveys, we demonstrate that even advanced models require multiple correction cycles to produce culturally accurate images, revealing persistent systemic biases. Our findings highlight critical ethical implications of the multi-step editing paradigm, including the risk of reinforcing cultural stereotypes and the burden placed on users to repeatedly correct AI-generated content. We propose an ethical framework for responsible image generation that emphasizes data transparency, cultural authenticity, and community-driven evaluation processes. This work contributes to the growing discourse on AI ethics by providing concrete evidence of ongoing bias issues and establishing foundations for more inclusive visual AI systems.

\section{Introduction}

The democratization of artificial intelligence has brought unprecedented capabilities in visual content generation, with text-to-image (T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) models achieving remarkable technical milestones. From Stable Diffusion's early iterations to cutting-edge models like FLUX-Kontext-Dev, these systems have revolutionized creative workflows and content production. However, beneath this technological progress lies a persistent and deeply concerning issue: the perpetuation of cultural biases that reflect and amplify societal inequalities.

Despite significant algorithmic advances from Stable Diffusion 1.4 to 3.5 and beyond, cultural representation remains problematically skewed toward Western perspectives, often reducing diverse global cultures to stereotypical visual tropes. This bias manifests not merely as a technical limitation but as a fundamental ethical challenge that undermines the promise of inclusive AI systems. When AI-generated imagery consistently misrepresents or oversimplifies cultural identities, it perpetuates digital colonialism and reinforces harmful stereotypes at unprecedented scale.

The emergence of state-of-the-art image-to-image (I2I) models as the current paradigm introduces new dimensions to this ethical landscape. Unlike traditional T2I generation, I2I workflows typically involve iterative refinement processes where users attempt to correct cultural inaccuracies through multiple editing cycles. This multi-step approach, while technically powerful, places an unfair burden on users to repeatedly educate AI systems about their own cultural contexts—a process that is both labor-intensive and potentially degrading.

Current bias mitigation research has primarily focused on algorithmic interventions and dataset augmentation, often treating cultural bias as a technical problem to be solved through engineering solutions. However, this approach overlooks the fundamental ethical dimensions of cultural representation, data stewardship, and user agency. The lack of transparency in training data sources, combined with the use of large-scale web-scraped datasets of unknown provenance, creates an ethical void where cultural authenticity cannot be verified or ensured.

This paper addresses these critical gaps by presenting the first systematic ethical analysis of cultural bias in the T2I → I2I pipeline. We investigate how many iterative editing steps are required to achieve culturally appropriate representations, using Korean and Chinese cultural contexts as case studies. Through controlled experiments and comprehensive user surveys, we quantify the bias correction burden placed on users and analyze the ethical implications of current generation paradigms.

Our contributions are threefold: (1) We provide empirical evidence of persistent cultural bias across multiple generation cycles, demonstrating that technical advances alone are insufficient to address representation issues; (2) We introduce a novel multi-step bias assessment framework that reveals the hidden costs of cultural correction in I2I workflows; and (3) We establish an ethical foundation for future research in responsible image generation, emphasizing the urgent need for transparent, community-driven approaches to visual AI development.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Cultural Bias in Image Generation Models}

The issue of cultural bias in AI-generated imagery has gained increasing attention as these systems have become more prevalent. Early studies on Stable Diffusion and DALL-E models revealed systematic underrepresentation of non-Western cultures and the tendency to default to Western visual stereotypes when generating culturally specific content. While subsequent research has proposed various debiasing techniques, including prompt engineering, fine-tuning approaches, and dataset curation methods, these interventions have largely focused on technical solutions rather than addressing the underlying ethical framework governing cultural representation.

Recent work has demonstrated that bias persists even in advanced models, suggesting that the problem extends beyond simple dataset imbalances to more fundamental issues of cultural understanding and representation validity. However, the majority of existing research treats bias as a measurable deviation from some ideal distribution, rather than examining the deeper ethical implications of AI systems making cultural representation decisions without appropriate cultural authority or community input.

\subsection{The Ethics of Data Stewardship}

A critical gap in current bias mitigation research lies in the realm of data ethics and stewardship. Most contemporary image generation models are trained on massive web-scraped datasets where the provenance, consent status, and cultural authenticity of images cannot be verified. This approach creates several ethical concerns: (1) the inability to trace image sources undermines accountability; (2) the lack of informed consent from depicted individuals violates principles of data ethics; and (3) the absence of cultural community involvement in dataset curation perpetuates extractive approaches to AI development.

While some recent efforts have attempted to create more ethically sourced datasets, these initiatives remain limited in scope and have not yet been integrated into mainstream model development pipelines. The field lacks a comprehensive framework for ethical data stewardship that prioritizes cultural authenticity, community ownership, and transparent provenance tracking.

\subsection{Iterative Editing and User Burden}

The rise of I2I models as the current state-of-the-art introduces new ethical considerations around user burden and the iterative correction process. While technical literature has extensively documented the capabilities of I2I systems, there has been minimal examination of the ethical implications of requiring users to repeatedly correct cultural misrepresentations. This iterative correction paradigm implicitly places the responsibility for cultural education on users, creating an asymmetric relationship where marginalized communities must continuously educate AI systems about their own cultural contexts.

Furthermore, the multi-step editing process may inadvertently reinforce biases by encouraging users to converge toward AI-suggested modifications rather than authentic cultural representations. The psychological and social impacts of this repeated correction cycle have not been systematically studied, representing a significant gap in our understanding of ethical AI deployment.


\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Experimental Design Overview}

Our research employs a systematic multi-step editing framework to assess cultural bias in contemporary image generation models. We designed two complementary experimental approaches that together provide both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights into the bias correction process. The methodology prioritizes ethical considerations throughout, ensuring that cultural authenticity assessment is conducted with appropriate community involvement and respect for cultural sovereignty.

\subsection{Experiment 1: Baseline Image Generation and Multi-Step Editing}

\subsubsection{Model Selection and Justification}
We selected FLUX-Kontext-Dev as our primary model due to its state-of-the-art performance in image-to-image tasks and its current status as a leading I2I generation system. To provide historical context and demonstrate bias persistence across model generations, we also conducted comparative experiments using Stable Diffusion 1.4, 3.5, and other contemporary models. This selection allows us to trace bias evolution across different architectural approaches and training paradigms.

\subsubsection{Cultural Context Selection}
We focused our analysis on Korean and Chinese cultural contexts for several strategic reasons: (1) these cultures have distinct visual traditions that are often misrepresented in Western-centric datasets; (2) both cultures have active AI research communities that can provide authentic evaluation; and (3) the visual elements of these cultures (traditional clothing, architecture, cultural practices) provide clear markers for bias assessment.

\subsubsection{Prompt Design and Initial Generation}
We developed a systematic set of culturally specific prompts designed to elicit representations that would reveal bias patterns. Our prompts were structured to test various aspects of cultural representation:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Traditional clothing and attire}: Prompts requesting traditional Korean hanbok or Chinese qipao in various contexts
\item \textbf{Cultural practices and ceremonies}: Descriptions of traditional festivals, wedding ceremonies, and religious practices
\item \textbf{Architectural elements}: Traditional buildings, gardens, and urban spaces
\item \textbf{Daily life scenarios}: Contemporary life situations that should reflect cultural authenticity
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h]
  \caption{Sample prompts used for cultural bias assessment}
  \label{table:sample-prompts}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    Category & Example Prompts \\
    \midrule
    Traditional Clothing & "Korean woman wearing traditional hanbok" \\
                         & "Chinese bride in traditional qipao dress" \\
    Cultural Practices & "Korean tea ceremony with traditional elements" \\
                      & "Chinese New Year celebration scene" \\
    Architecture & "Traditional Korean hanok house design" \\
                & "Classical Chinese garden pavilion" \\
    Daily Life & "Modern Korean family dinner setting" \\
              & "Contemporary Chinese street food vendor" \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For each prompt category, we generated initial images using T2I capabilities, creating our baseline dataset for subsequent iterative editing analysis.

\subsubsection{Multi-Step Editing Protocol}
The core innovation of our methodology lies in the systematic analysis of the I2I editing process. For each baseline image, we implemented a structured editing protocol:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{5cm} \rule[-.5cm]{12cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Multi-step editing protocol flowchart. Visual representation of the 6-step process from T2I generation through iterative I2I refinements, including decision points for cultural appropriateness assessment and termination criteria.}
  \label{fig:editing-protocol}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Step 1}: Generate initial image using T2I from culturally specific prompt
\item \textbf{Steps 2-6}: Apply I2I editing with progressively refined prompts (e.g., "make this more authentically Korean," "adjust to better reflect Chinese cultural elements")
\item \textbf{Assessment}: Evaluate cultural authenticity at each step using both automated metrics and human evaluation
\item \textbf{Termination}: Record the step number at which cultural appropriateness is achieved, or note if acceptable quality is never reached within 5 editing cycles
\end{enumerate}

This protocol allows us to quantify the "bias correction burden"—the number of iterative edits required to achieve culturally appropriate representation.

\subsection{Experiment 2: Bias Identification and Correction Analysis}

\subsubsection{Systematic Bias Detection}
Our second experiment specifically targets pre-existing biased images to assess correction capabilities. We identified culturally inappropriate images through a preliminary screening process involving cultural experts from Korean and Chinese communities. These images exhibit common bias patterns such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Conflation of different Asian cultures
\item Stereotypical or exoticized representations
\item Anachronistic combinations of cultural elements
\item Inappropriate cultural appropriation scenarios
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Correction Efficacy Assessment}
For each identified biased image, we applied the same multi-step editing protocol to assess the model's ability to correct cultural misrepresentations. This allows us to measure not only initial bias levels but also the effectiveness of iterative correction processes.

\subsection{User Survey and Community Evaluation}

\subsubsection{Participant Recruitment and Ethics}
We recruited participants from Korean and Chinese communities through ethical community engagement practices. Participants were compensated fairly for their time and expertise, and the study received approval from relevant ethical review boards. Our recruitment strategy prioritized cultural authenticity by including individuals with deep cultural knowledge and lived experience.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Framework}
Participants evaluated images at each editing step using a comprehensive cultural authenticity assessment framework:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{12cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Cultural authenticity evaluation framework. Interactive interface showing the 4-dimension assessment tool used by community evaluators, including sample evaluation screens and rating scales.}
  \label{fig:evaluation-framework}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cultural Accuracy}: Does the image accurately represent the intended cultural elements?
\item \textbf{Stereotyping Assessment}: Does the image rely on harmful or reductive stereotypes?
\item \textbf{Cultural Sensitivity}: Are cultural elements treated with appropriate respect and context?
\item \textbf{Contemporary Relevance}: Does the representation reflect contemporary cultural realities rather than outdated assumptions?
\end{itemize}

Each dimension was evaluated using a 7-point Likert scale, with qualitative feedback encouraged to capture nuanced cultural perspectives.

\begin{table}[h]
  \caption{User survey participant demographics}
  \label{table:participant-demographics}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    Demographic & Korean Participants & Chinese Participants \\
    \midrule
    Total Participants & 45 & 42 \\
    Age Range & 22-54 years & 25-58 years \\
    Cultural Expertise & 89\% native speakers & 86\% native speakers \\
    AI Experience & 67\% regular users & 71\% regular users \\
    Geographic Distribution & 73\% Korea, 27\% diaspora & 69\% China, 31\% diaspora \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Statistical Analysis Approach}
We employed mixed-effects models to analyze the relationship between editing step number and cultural authenticity scores, controlling for prompt type, cultural context, and individual evaluator differences. This approach allows us to quantify the bias correction process while accounting for the inherent subjectivity in cultural evaluation.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations in Methodology}

Our methodology prioritizes ethical research practices throughout:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cultural Authority}: Evaluation criteria were developed in consultation with cultural experts rather than imposed externally
\item \textbf{Compensation Equity}: Community evaluators were compensated at rates reflecting their expertise and time investment
\item \textbf{Data Sovereignty}: All cultural evaluation data remains controlled by respective community representatives
\item \textbf{Harm Minimization}: The study design minimizes exposure to potentially offensive misrepresentations while still gathering necessary data
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Multi-Step Editing Analysis}

Our systematic analysis of the T2I → I2I pipeline reveals concerning patterns in cultural bias persistence across multiple editing cycles. The quantitative results demonstrate that achieving culturally appropriate representations requires significantly more iterative corrections than would be acceptable in an ethical AI deployment scenario.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{6cm} \rule[-.5cm]{12cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Multi-step editing progression for Korean cultural context. Shows T2I initial generation (Step 1) through I2I refinements (Steps 2-6) with cultural authenticity scores. Will include: before/after image pairs, user evaluation scores, and editing prompt evolution.}
  \label{fig:korean-editing-steps}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Bias Correction Burden Quantification}

Across all tested prompts, the average number of editing steps required to achieve culturally appropriate representation was 3.7 (±1.2) for Korean cultural contexts and 4.1 (±1.3) for Chinese cultural contexts. Notably, 23\% of generated images never achieved acceptable cultural accuracy within the 5-step editing limit, suggesting fundamental limitations in the bias correction capabilities of current I2I systems.

\begin{table}[h]
  \caption{Average editing steps required by content category}
  \label{table:editing-steps-by-category}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    Content Category & Korean Context & Chinese Context \\
    \midrule
    Traditional Clothing & 2.8 (±0.9) & 3.1 (±1.0) \\
    Cultural Practices & 4.6 (±1.4) & 4.8 (±1.6) \\
    Architecture & 3.2 (±1.1) & 3.5 (±1.2) \\
    Daily Life Scenarios & 4.1 (±1.3) & 4.4 (±1.5) \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The distribution of editing steps required varied significantly by content category. Traditional clothing representations required an average of 2.8 steps, while cultural practices and ceremonies required 4.6 steps on average. This pattern suggests that surface-level visual elements are more easily corrected than complex cultural contexts that require deeper cultural understanding.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{5cm} \rule[-.5cm]{12cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Distribution of editing steps required to achieve cultural appropriateness. Bar chart showing frequency distribution for Korean and Chinese contexts, highlighting the 23\% of images that never achieved acceptable quality within 5 steps.}
  \label{fig:editing-steps-distribution}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Comparative Analysis Across Model Generations}

Our comparison across different model versions reveals that technological advancement has not consistently improved cultural representation quality. While Stable Diffusion 3.5 showed marginal improvements over 1.4 in initial generation quality (average first-step cultural authenticity score of 3.2 vs 2.8 on a 7-point scale), the number of editing steps required for cultural appropriateness remained statistically unchanged (p=0.34).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{6cm} \rule[-.5cm]{12cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Model comparison across generations. Side-by-side comparison of SD 1.4, SD 3.5, and FLUX-Kontext-Dev showing: (a) initial generation quality scores, (b) average editing steps required, (c) cultural authenticity progression curves.}
  \label{fig:model-comparison}
\end{figure}

FLUX-Kontext-Dev, despite its superior I2I capabilities, actually required more editing steps on average (4.2) compared to earlier models. This counterintuitive result suggests that technical sophistication in image manipulation does not necessarily translate to improved cultural sensitivity.

\subsection{User Survey Results}

\subsubsection{Cultural Authenticity Assessment}

Community evaluators provided comprehensive assessments of cultural authenticity across all editing steps. The results reveal a complex relationship between technical image quality and cultural appropriateness. While later editing steps generally showed improved technical coherence, cultural authenticity scores often plateaued or even decreased after the third editing step.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{5cm} \rule[-.5cm]{12cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Cultural authenticity scores across editing steps. Line graphs for Korean and Chinese contexts showing mean scores with confidence intervals. Includes plateau effect after step 3 and occasional degradation in later steps.}
  \label{fig:authenticity-scores}
\end{figure}

Korean community evaluators reported that 67\% of images generated in the first step contained identifiable cultural errors, including conflation with other Asian cultures (34\%), stereotypical representations (28\%), and anachronistic elements (31\%). After 3 editing steps, cultural error rates decreased to 31\%, but further editing beyond this point showed diminishing returns.

\begin{table}[h]
  \caption{Types of cultural errors by editing step}
  \label{table:error-types}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    \toprule
    Error Type & Step 1 & Step 3 & Step 5 \\
    \midrule
    Cultural Conflation & 34\% & 18\% & 15\% \\
    Stereotypical Representation & 28\% & 12\% & 14\% \\
    Anachronistic Elements & 31\% & 16\% & 18\% \\
    Context Misappropriation & 22\% & 11\% & 13\% \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Chinese community evaluators identified similar patterns, with 71\% of first-step images containing cultural inaccuracies. The improvement trajectory followed a similar pattern, with optimal cultural authenticity typically achieved by the third editing step, beyond which additional corrections often introduced new cultural inconsistencies.

\subsubsection{Qualitative Feedback Analysis}

Participant feedback revealed several concerning themes in the multi-step editing process:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{12cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Word cloud and sentiment analysis of participant feedback. Visual representation of frequently mentioned concerns including "cultural fatigue," "stereotypical," "repetitive correction," and "educational burden."}
  \label{fig:feedback-analysis}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Cultural Fatigue}: Participants reported experiencing frustration and emotional fatigue when required to repeatedly correct basic cultural misrepresentations. Many expressed that the burden of cultural education should not fall on community members using AI tools.

\textbf{Convergence Toward Stereotypes}: Multiple participants noted that I2I editing suggestions often pushed images toward more stereotypical representations rather than authentic cultural depictions. This suggests that the iterative process may actually reinforce rather than correct biases.

\textbf{Context Degradation}: Extended editing cycles frequently resulted in loss of cultural context, with traditional elements becoming decontextualized or inappropriately combined. This pattern indicates that current I2I systems lack sufficient cultural knowledge to maintain coherent cultural narratives across editing steps.

  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{6cm} \rule[-.5cm]{12cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Example of context degradation across editing steps. Sequential images showing how traditional Korean hanbok elements become increasingly decontextualized and stereotypical through repeated I2I editing cycles.}
  \label{fig:context-degradation}
\end{figure}

\section{Ethical Implications}

\subsection{The Bias Correction Burden}

Our findings reveal a fundamental ethical problem in current image generation paradigms: the systematic placement of bias correction burden on the very communities most affected by misrepresentation. The requirement for multiple editing cycles to achieve cultural authenticity creates an asymmetric relationship where marginalized communities must continuously educate AI systems about their own cultural contexts.

This burden is particularly problematic given that it is unpaid, unrecognized labor that extends beyond simple usage into cultural education and consultation. The average 3.7-4.1 editing steps required for cultural appropriateness represents significant time investment that accumulates across millions of users and usage sessions.

\subsection{Systemic Reinforcement of Cultural Hierarchies}

The persistent bias across model generations suggests that current training paradigms systematically encode cultural hierarchies that reflect training data distributions. The fact that Western cultural representations require fewer corrections while non-Western cultures require extensive editing cycles perpetuates digital colonialism and reinforces existing power imbalances in global technology systems.

Furthermore, the tendency for extended editing to converge toward stereotypical representations indicates that current I2I systems may be actively harmful to cultural authenticity efforts. Rather than supporting diverse cultural expression, these systems appear to constrain representation toward a limited set of recognizable but potentially reductive visual tropes.

\subsection{Data Stewardship and Accountability}

Our results highlight the urgent need for transparent, ethically sourced training data with clear provenance tracking. The inability to identify the sources of cultural representations in current models makes it impossible to verify authenticity, obtain proper consent, or provide appropriate attribution to cultural communities.

The persistent bias across multiple model generations suggests that technical debiasing approaches are insufficient without fundamental changes to data collection and curation practices. Simply applying algorithmic corrections to biased datasets perpetuates the underlying problem while creating an illusion of progress.

\subsection{User Agency and Dignity}

The multi-step editing paradigm raises serious questions about user dignity and agency in AI interactions. Requiring users to repeatedly correct cultural misrepresentations places them in the position of supplicants requesting accurate representation of their own cultures. This dynamic is both practically burdensome and psychologically degrading, particularly for users from marginalized communities.

\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}

\subsection{Summary of Findings}

This research provides the first systematic ethical analysis of cultural bias in the T2I → I2I generation pipeline, revealing persistent and concerning patterns that challenge assumptions about technological progress in AI bias mitigation. Our key findings demonstrate that:

First, current state-of-the-art image generation models require an average of 3.7-4.1 editing cycles to achieve culturally appropriate representations for Korean and Chinese contexts, with 23\% of images never reaching acceptable cultural accuracy within reasonable editing limits. This quantifies the substantial "bias correction burden" placed on users, particularly those from marginalized communities.

Second, technological advancement from Stable Diffusion 1.4 to 3.5 and FLUX-Kontext-Dev has not yielded corresponding improvements in cultural representation quality. Despite sophisticated technical capabilities, these systems continue to perpetuate systematic cultural biases that reflect the fundamental problems in their training data and development processes.

Third, the iterative editing process often reinforces rather than corrects cultural stereotypes, with extended editing cycles leading to convergence toward reductive cultural representations. This finding challenges the assumption that user-guided iterative correction can serve as an effective bias mitigation strategy.

\subsection{Implications for AI Ethics and Policy}

Our findings have significant implications for AI governance and ethical deployment practices. The persistent bias across model generations indicates that current approaches to bias mitigation—primarily focused on algorithmic interventions—are insufficient to address the root causes of cultural misrepresentation in AI systems.

The systematic placement of bias correction burden on affected communities represents a form of digital colonialism that perpetuates existing power imbalances. Policymakers and AI developers must recognize that requiring marginalized communities to repeatedly educate AI systems about their own cultures is ethically unacceptable and practically unsustainable.

Furthermore, the emotional labor and psychological harm associated with repeated cultural correction, evidenced by participant reports of "cultural fatigue," represents a category of AI harm that current regulatory frameworks fail to address. Future AI governance must expand beyond traditional concepts of bias to encompass the dignity and agency of users in AI interactions.

\subsection{Toward Ethical Image Generation Systems}

Based on our findings, we propose several principles for developing more ethical image generation systems:

\textbf{Community-Centered Development}: AI systems affecting cultural representation must be developed with meaningful participation from the communities they represent, not merely evaluated by them post-hoc.

\textbf{Transparent Data Stewardship}: Training datasets must have clear provenance tracking, verified consent, and community ownership structures that ensure cultural authenticity and appropriate attribution.

\textbf{Proactive Bias Prevention}: Rather than placing correction burden on users, AI systems should be designed to prevent cultural misrepresentation through careful training data curation and community-validated evaluation processes.

\textbf{Accountability Infrastructure}: Mechanisms for community feedback, rapid bias correction, and transparent reporting must be built into AI deployment pipelines from the outset.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

This work establishes a foundation for future research in ethical AI development that addresses both technical and social dimensions of bias mitigation. Several critical research directions emerge from our findings:

\textbf{Scalable Community Engagement}: Research is needed to develop scalable methods for meaningful community participation in AI training and evaluation processes. This includes investigating reward structures, recognition systems, and governance models that fairly compensate communities for their cultural expertise.

\textbf{Alternative Training Paradigms}: Our findings suggest that current large-scale web scraping approaches to dataset creation are fundamentally incompatible with ethical cultural representation. Future research should explore alternative training paradigms that prioritize quality, provenance, and community consent over scale.

\textbf{Cultural Authenticity Metrics}: The field needs better methods for measuring cultural authenticity that go beyond surface-level visual similarity to encompass cultural meaning, context, and community validation.

\textbf{Harm-Aware Evaluation}: Traditional bias metrics fail to capture the psychological and social harms identified in our study. Future research should develop evaluation frameworks that account for user dignity, emotional labor, and long-term impacts on cultural communities.

\textbf{Technological Solutions}: While our findings demonstrate that technical advances alone are insufficient, they also point toward specific technological research directions. These include developing AI systems with explainable cultural reasoning, implementing real-time community feedback mechanisms, and creating model architectures that can be rapidly updated with community input.

The development of truly ethical AI systems for visual content generation will require unprecedented collaboration between AI researchers, cultural communities, ethicists, and policymakers. This research provides evidence that such collaboration is not merely desirable but essential for creating AI systems that serve all communities with dignity and respect.

Our work also establishes the groundwork for future technical research into bias mitigation strategies that do not place correction burden on affected communities. By quantifying the current state of bias persistence and documenting its ethical implications, we hope to inspire both policy changes and technical innovations that prioritize community sovereignty and cultural authenticity in AI development.
